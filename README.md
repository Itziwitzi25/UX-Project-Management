### Chapter 01: Project Management Definition, Teams and Roles, Frameworks

This chapter introduces **UX Project Management** as taught at Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, with Christian Stengel as a Senior User Experience Designer working on enterprise logistics software. The course schedule includes classes on Thursdays and Fridays, along with practical workshops on Saturdays.

The semester will cover various key topics, including **Methodologies**, **Artefacts of Project Management**, **People and Communication**, and **Metrics**. Initial activities for students include **brainstorming** what comes to mind regarding UX Project Management and forming teams of 5-6 people for practical exercises.

The first topics delve into **"This is UX Project Management,"** exploring its importance, its place within the **Project Management and Product Development Lifecycle**, and **defining Project Management** itself. It also examines **Roles in Digital Product Development**, including various roles in the digital world, defining responsibilities, and UX's role in the process. Furthermore, the course will cover **"Working in Frameworks,"** focusing on **Agile**, **Classical Waterfall Structures**, and a **hybrid approach** to digital products and projects.

**Project Management** is described as the **art of steering the process, aligning the team, and enabling people to get the work done**. Nancy Lyon, CEO and President of Clockworks, suggests that "Project Management is like air quality. If you can see it, itâ€™s probably killing you," emphasizing its often invisible but crucial nature.

Alignment is crucial in project management across several areas:
*   **Goals**: What to achieve, do, and why.
*   **Priorities**: What is currently important, how to create value, and what to tackle first.
*   **People and Culture**: With whom and for whom to work, and how to collaborate.
*   **Actions**: Decisions, working terms, and daily tools.
*   **Metrics and Data**: What success looks like, how to measure progress, and which data helps decision-making.
*   **Requirements**: Why people should use the product, how to make tasks easier, and how to solve problems.

Ultimately, successful project or product outcomes require steering people to align on all these topics. The sources emphasize that **"It is about people. The way we communicate and work with each other,"** and ensuring the team moves in the right direction. Examples like the **Google Development Lifecycle** and **Miro: idea to outcome** are used to illustrate how to steer people through a project and identify what's important at each stage. Project management provides **methodologies and frameworks** to navigate project stages and product development, guiding the documentation of work, decisions, and outcome measurement. Marty Cagan, Partner and Product Manager at Silicon Valley Product Group, advises, "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing".

Definitions of UX Project Management include:
*   **User experience (UX) management**: Managing UX design-related activities within an organization to foster growth and good management practices. This involves defining an organization's UX design language, strategy, and managing work processes around UX design.
*   **Digital Project Managers (DPMs)**: They gather, curate, translate, and communicate to deliver projects on time and on budget. DPMs ensure the team has the necessary resources, time, and skills.
*   **UX (user experience) project management**: Combines traditional project management techniques with UX design principles to create digital products that meet or exceed user expectations. UX project managers oversee improving user experience across digital platforms like websites, apps, or other applications requiring user interaction.

A task is given to research definitions and write a personal version of UX Project Management in 3-5 sentences within teams.

The digital world is described as a **highly cross-functional workplace** with teams composed of diverse skillsets and roles. There's no set rule for team composition, as it varies by company, project, or product focus, making it crucial to assess needed roles and skillsets for success. **Frameworks can help set up teams and collaboratively define responsibilities**.

A **Skill Matrix** is presented as a tool to quickly overview a team's ability to solve tasks, often using a rating from 0-3 or 1-4 per task or category to describe ability levels. It can also aid in hiring new people with the right skills. Once the right people are in place, ensuring everyone knows their tasks and responsibilities is critical to avoid conflicts or loss of focus.

The **RACI Matrix** is introduced as a "Deep Dive" topic. **RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed**. This matrix clarifies roles within a team, aiding communication and work distribution.
*   **Responsible**: The person actively doing the work, handling a task, creating a deliverable.
*   **Accountable**: The person who checks that the work is done successfully and on time, stepping in to find solutions for delays or disturbances.
*   **Consulted**: The person who needs to know things *before* a decision is made, often involving strategic decisions.
*   **Informed**: The person who needs to know things *after* a decision is made, typically stakeholders, business owners, or C-level executives.
The roles in a RACI Matrix may vary for each project and should be defined with the team in the starting phase. It's useful when opinions clash or decisions are unclear, helping identify who has the authority to steer.

**Delegation Poker** is another method for teams to clarify roles in a self-organized manner, applicable to the whole team or individual roles. It involves writing down work scenarios and using a Delegation Poker board with roles. A task involves playing a round of Delegation Poker within teams. Ultimately, **clear responsibilities help focus, improve efficiency, and enhance meetings**.

The roles a User Experience person can take depend on the company's **maturity towards user experience and design** and its structure. UX teams can vary in structure and size. Examples of UX roles and team structures include:
*   **UX Design and Research in a cross-functional team**: Including UX Designers, Frontend/Backend Developers, Product Owners, UX Researchers, and Fullstack Developers.
*   **UX Insights working as a driver for innovation**: Incorporating Marketing and Analytics and Data Science to bring research insights into development.
*   **User Centric Approach throughout the whole company**: User Experience steers the company, with roles like UX Researcher, UX Strategist, UX Designer, Service Designer, interacting with Business, Product, Marketing, HR, and Design departments.
User Experience is a broad field, participating in various steps of a product journey or company development.

Regarding frameworks, **Agile, Waterfall, and Hybrid** approaches are common choices for products and projects. Frameworks provide a **mutual understanding of the process** and **standards for how and when work is done, and who is responsible**. Each approach has its pros and cons.
*   **Waterfall**: A sequential method where phases are dependent on each other, carried out one after the other, with progress flowing in one direction.
*   **Agile**: A more flexible, adaptive method open to change, dealing with dependencies through cross-functional teams.
Students are tasked to research these frameworks and find example projects for their use.

The summary of this chapter reiterates the introduction and definition of Project Management, looking into teams, clarifying responsibilities, understanding UX Roles, and the frameworks (Agile, Waterfall, Hybrid). The **examination** will be a written exam (45-60 minutes) consisting mostly of multiple-choice or single-choice questions, with some short self-written answers, and no aids permitted.

### Chapter 02: Scrum, Kick-Off, Discovery

This chapter focuses on **Kick-off, Scrum, and Discovery** for products and projects.

**Scrum** is presented as an **agile framework** that incorporates the values of the **Agile Manifesto**. The Agile Manifesto values **individuals and interactions over processes and tools**, **working software over comprehensive documentation**, **customer collaboration over contract negotiation**, and **responding to change over following a plan**. Scrum helps people and teams deliver value incrementally in a collaborative way and provides just enough structure to optimize for specific needs.

Key Scrum concepts and artifacts ("Deep Dive"):
*   **The Sprint**: Fixed-length events (one month or less) where ideas are turned into value, providing consistency. A new Sprint begins immediately after the previous one.
*   **The Product Backlog**: An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve or build the product. It's the single source of work for the Scrum Team, incorporating the product goal and items, reflecting the roadmap. It is one of the Scrum Artefacts.
*   **Backlog Refinement**: A meeting to break down Product Backlog Items into smaller, more refined, and estimated pieces, making them actionable for a Sprint.
*   **Sprint Planning**: A timeboxed meeting to move work items from the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog, resulting in a clear Sprint Goal. The development team can further break down work items into tasks.
*   **The Sprint Backlog**: A plan by and for the Developers, a visible, real-time picture of work planned for the Sprint to achieve the Sprint Goal, consisting of items from the Product Backlog. It is one of the Scrum Artefacts.
*   **Daily (or Standup)**: A brief, recurring meeting (max 15 mins) where team members highlight work done the previous day, what they'll tackle today, and address roadblocks.
*   **Sprint Review**: Inspecting the sprint's outcome, presenting results to stakeholders, highlighting new value, addressing changing requirements, and checking Product Backlog progress.
*   **Increment**: A concrete, usable stepping stone towards the Product Goal (finished work), additive to prior Increments and thoroughly verified. It is one of the Scrum Artefacts.
*   **Retrospective**: A meeting solely for Scrum Team members to identify what went well and what to improve in the next sprint, also considering individuals' moods and feelings.

A Scrum overview illustrates items from the Product Backlog constantly refined, learnings taken into the next Sprint, incremental value creation, and new sprints starting immediately after the previous one.

**Why use Scrum?** It enables quick and careful reaction to changing requirements, helping control risk through its flexibility.

A **"Quick Look towards Lean"** is provided:
*   **Lean** is based on principles designed to **eliminate waste** and improve company processes.
*   **Lean UX** focuses on the user experience under design, less on deliverables than traditional UX.
*   It involves working with **Problem Statements and Assumptions**, aiming for the easiest and fastest solutions (MVP approach) to get quick feedback for iterations.
*   Lean concepts emphasize eliminating waste, cutting unnecessary requirements and unhelpful processes, and focusing on **continuous testing and improvement**.
*   Scrum incorporates many Lean ideas, as both are agile frameworks. Both frameworks have an **iterative concept** at their heart, focusing on **creating value** and remaining flexible and adaptive.

**Moving into a project or product** requires understanding it deeply. Key initial steps include:
*   **Determine the business goal**: What the business aims to achieve.
*   **Check for alignment** between business goal and product.
*   **Check the proposed timeline**: Are resources available and scope clear for goal attainment.
*   **Assess readiness**: Is everything prepared to start, or are resources needed first.
**Checklists** are helpful tools to go step-by-step and not overlook important information. Examples of checklist categories include Kickoff, Research, Project Plan, and Feature. A task involves making a personal checklist based on these examples. Checklists should be treated as **living documents**, adaptable to project type and flexible enough not to strictly adhere to a list.

**Sharing the brief and kicking off the project or product** involves refining the brief and preparing information for the kick-off meeting in an understandable manner. The **project kickoff** is a critical project management activity in the initiation phase, preparing the team and client on expectations, communication, and collaboration.

What should be included in a Kick-off:
*   **Background of the project**
*   **Team Members and Roles**
*   **Scope**
*   **Risks and Opportunities**
*   **Responsibilities**
*   **Communication Plan**
*   **Timeline**
*   **Next Steps**
*   **Success Criteria**.
It's important to consider who needs to be part of the kick-off, prepare an agenda and protocol for documentation, and follow up on open questions and next steps afterward. Setting up regular, recurring meetings (e.g., Scrum Meetings, Stakeholder Exchanges) is also important.

The **Project Canvas** is introduced as another tool to clarify ideas and think about scope in the starting phase. It's based on visual tools like the business model canvas and helps establish an overview, serving as a briefing tool for stakeholders. It's a **"Pre-project tool to kickstart projects and specify 'what is the purpose?', 'why is it undertaken?' and 'how should it be delivered?'"**. Sections of the Project Canvas include Purpose, Resources, Risks + Chances, Customer, Result, Budget, Team, Environs, Waypoints, Quality, and Time.

The **roadmap** is defined as a **strategic, living artifact that aligns, prioritizes, and communicates the vision and plan** of a project or product. Initial steps or milestones identified during the kick-off can help build it. If not, the team should break down the project, estimate what needs to be done, and create a rough timeframe for milestones as a first draft. Common roadmap formats include **Gantt Charts**. A minimal roadmap should include the work/desired outcome as a title, milestones indicating when parts are usable, and a timeline. A task is given to build an example roadmap for the "Discover Europe" project.

**Discovery** is key to filling roadmap items with insights and understanding what is being solved. The **Double Diamond Framework** helps navigate this path.
*   It's a **"Framework for Innovation"** by the Design Council, involving **Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver** phases.
*   It distinguishes between the **Problem Space (Discover, Define)** and **Solution Space (Develop, Deliver)**.
*   **Discover**: The first diamond helps understand the problem, involving speaking to and spending time with affected people. It's a **divergent phase** to gather as much information as possible (e.g., interviews, competitor analysis, surveys, journey mapping, secondary research, observations).
*   **Define**: Taking discovery results to narrow down the problem and define possible solutions. Insights are transferred into a vision and a first plan, defining scope (what's included/excluded). Outputs include Problem-Solution Statements, User Stories, Roadmaps, Feature Descriptions, Acceptance Criteria.
*   **Develop**: The second diamond encourages different answers to the defined problem, seeking inspiration and co-designing. It's a **divergent phase** for exploring ideas (e.g., brainstorming, 6P Stories, Event Storming, Usability Testing, Prototyping, Surveys, Storyboarding).
*   **Deliver**: Testing solutions at a small scale, rejecting what doesn't work, and improving what does. This iterative implementation phase can incorporate additional feedback (e.g., 6P Story Demo, Onboardings, Reviews, CI/CD, Pair Programming, QA-Testing, Beta Testing).

The four core principles of the Double Diamond framework are: **Put people first, Communicate visually and inclusively, Collaborate and co-create, and Iterate, Iterate, Iterate**. The ideal scenario follows the full diamond path, but reality might involve adapting the process. Understanding the challenge deeply helps narrow down solutions, and structured exploration aids decision-making. The framework provides guidance through new challenges or unforeseen events. Other frameworks like the Zendesk Triple Diamond or The Problem Solving Cube exist, as there is "no 'one fits all' framework".

**Assumption Mapping** is a helpful tool for better defining problems and quickly formatting ideas for validation. Assumptions are ideas created from discovery phase outcomes, based on data input but not yet validated. Examples include "People want to discover new places during their holidays" or "Our target group likes to enjoy outdoor activities". To validate assumptions, they are checked against criteria: **Viability (business goals), Desirability (user enjoyment), Feasibility (implementation within constraints), and Usability (clarity and understandability)**. The Assumption Matrix maps assumptions based on **Importance** (Important/Unimportant) and **Evidence** (Have Evidence/No Evidence). The recommendation is to **"Test assumptions with high importance and no evidence first"** as this is where the most potential is hidden. Assumptions can be tested in the discovery phase to gain evidence, influencing the define phase, or in the develop phase to confirm an assumption and check the best solution. A task involves writing and mapping assumptions for the Discover Europe project.

The summary for this chapter includes Frameworks (Agile, Waterfall, Hybrid), Checklists for project intake, Kick-off Meetings, Roadmap, Double Diamond Model, other frameworks, and Assumption Mapping.

### Chapter 03: Discovery, Scope, Prioritization, Vision, Research

This chapter covers **Prioritization, Defining Scope, and Managing human-centered design in cross-disciplinary teams**.

**Defining Scope**:
*   **Scope** specifies what will be included in a project, product, feature, or initiative, providing clear expectations of the outcome.
*   Combined with a roadmap, it indicates what comes first.
*   Scope can influence and be influenced by **timeline, resources, budget, and skillset**.
*   It involves evaluating what is possible in terms of ideation, creation, and implementation within given constraints, serving as a clear outline for communication.
*   **Scoping is a team sport**, requiring the involvement of the whole team to achieve a common understanding, as everyone has a different perspective.
*   Scoping can be done at different stages:
    *   **Before the project starts** (e.g., within the kickoff or through the brief).
    *   When **defining the problem** (more precise for smaller parts of the project/product).
    *   Continuously while working with the team, for every planned item of work in **Backlog Refinement** (Scrum) and planning sessions.
*   **Backlog refinement** is a continuous process to create actionable Product Backlog Items, constantly improving them with more details to gain a clearer picture.
*   **Sprint Planning** initiates the Sprint by laying out the work, created collaboratively by the entire team.
*   In agile development, **scope for work items is continuously refined**, with changes or additions possible, but ultimately becoming clearer with each iteration or Sprint.
*   New information or changed requirements are documented and discussed to create common understanding, and work items are estimated using **Planning Poker**.
*   **Pitfalls of scoping**: Think about insights, resources, and skillsets; ensure alignment. When estimating work, consider time (travel, meetings), approvals, feedback loops, bugs, and errors. Estimate with buffer time for larger features or projects. Tasks should be actionable, clear, and timewise realistic; if too big, break them down or remove them. Allan Kelly states, "You know a task is too big because it is difficult to finish. If it is difficult to finish it needed more thought up front, to define and understand it, to bind it". A task is provided to define the scope for cleaning a house under different scenarios.

**Prioritization**:
*   It's the discipline of **letting go of less important things to focus on the most important ones**.
*   It helps define scope, narrow down next steps, and create a project/product vision.
*   Several tools aid this process:
    *   **Impact-Effort Matrix**: Prioritize tasks by **High Impact/Low Effort ("Do first")**, then **High Impact/High Effort ("Do second")**, then **Low Impact/Low Effort ("Do third" or automate)**, and finally **Low Impact/High Effort ("Do last or don't do at all")**. This can be used for sprint planning.
    *   **Eisenhower Matrix**: Focuses on **urgency and importance**. **Important/Urgent ("Do now")**, **Important/Less Urgent ("Take in and schedule for later")**, **Less Important/Urgent ("Delegate or get help")**, **Less Important/Less Urgent ("Don't do" or "phase two idea")**. Dwight D. Eisenhower is quoted: "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent".
    *   **Impact-Feasibility Matrix**: The darker areas (high impact, high feasibility) indicate higher priority.
*   **The MVP Approach (Minimum Valuable Product / Minimum Viable Product)**: Aims for the highest outcome with the least resources and time to prove a concept or idea. Prioritizing for an MVP means:
    *   Focus on **small, polished features**, not half-baked ones.
    *   **Prune (reduce) features, not quality** (e.g., using MoSCoW List: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have).
    *   Align on **fewer goals** for easier navigation and steering.
    *   Focus on **outcomes, not features**.
    *   **Evaluate risks**: Tackle potential risks and bottlenecks early.
    The goal is to have a **working product at every stage and iteration**, focusing on usable, working small features.
*   It's recommended to **use more than one method** for different perspectives and better-informed decisions.
*   **Involve the team** in prioritization to create a shared understanding and transparency.
*   **Kano Model**: Factors in user needs and reactions, identifying three types of initiatives: **basic, excitement, and performance**, to help product teams prioritize features that satisfy and delight customers.

**Managing human-centered design in cross-disciplinary teams**:
*   While agile frameworks, scoping, and prioritization tools are general project management tools, there are specific tools and practices for **User Experience**.
*   UX design activities can be planned and managed like the project itself, leading to better outcomes when well-planned.
*   **Plannable UX tasks/activities/deliverables**: Usability Testings, User Research, Guidelines, Design Systems, Tester Panel, UX Vision, Resources (Tools, People), Product Documentation, Audits, Metrics and KPIs, Testing Reports.
*   A **(UX) vision** is an **aspirational, future-state view of an experience people will have with a product, service, team, or organization**, providing guidance for all activities. Examples: "We want to create the go to place for all people booking surprising adventures on the web" or "The UX Team creates an app for vision impaired people to reach all their destinations for official governmental appointments with ease".
*   Actions should be planned to fulfill the UX Vision, splitting it into **Objectives and Tactics** to focus work.
*   **Purpose** can be an additional pillar to inform the vision and create alignment. The **Purpose Wheel (Ideo's Purpose Wheel)** is a tool for generative conversations about future goals, helping leadership align on "the why". It works best by trying out five types of impact and eliminating those not aligned with business strategy or long-term vision.
*   **The Research Plan**: A **guide for performing and documenting user research**, acting as a guideline or living document. It includes explanations of tactics, methods, timelines, scope, and responsibilities, keeping the vision and tactics at heart to focus efforts.
    *   **Benefits of using research plans**: Streamlined processes, structure, work towards specific goals, aligned and engaged stakeholders, and documentation.
    *   **Information to include**: Strategy/goals reminder, research objectives, target audience (sample sizes, demographics), timeline, expectations.
    *   **Evolving plan information**: Overview of testing methods, test setup/questions, necessary preparations/requirements, script (for usability tests), metrics/KPIs, cost estimations.
    *   Research plans should be **accessible and shared** with the team, stakeholders, and other parties. Examples include testing protocols, research plan templates (focusing on Problem Statement, Goals, Hypothesis), and research repositories. A task is given to build a research plan for the Discover Europe project.

The summary for this chapter includes Defining Scope, Prioritization Frameworks, MVP Approach, Creating a Vision, Purpose, and Research Plans.

### Chapter 04: Deliverables, Metrics and Communication

This chapter addresses **Deliverables, Cost Justification, and Measuring UX**, along with communication. Recommended readings include "Transformational products" by Matthias Schrader, "Inspired: How to create tech products customers love" by Marty Cagan, "Branded Interactions" by Marco Spies and Katja Wenger, and "This is Service Design Thinking" by Marc Stickdorn, Jakob Schneider and others. Podcasts like "The Product Podcast" and "Die Produktwerker" are also suggested.

**Deliverables**:
*   Deliverables clarify **what is expected to be done**, helping to perform tasks, document, and communicate.
*   **Common deliverables for UX practitioners** include: Reports, Userflows, Sitemaps, Test setups/plans, User Stories, Prototypes, Design documentation, Design Systems, Wireframes, Mockups, and Decision trees.
*   These deliverables can be **informative or actionable**.
*   In cross-disciplinary teams, defining deliverables for each phase creates clarity on what others can expect.
*   If a UX person/team delivers something others depend on, it's important to **share often and early**, and discuss the deliverable to ensure shared understanding.
*   **Examples of deliverables**:
    *   **Design Documentation**: Used as a handover between designers and developers, or as component documentation in a Design System.
    *   **Userflow**: Shows user paths to complete tasks on a website/app, providing insights into interaction points, decisions, and needed information.
    *   **Reports**: Make information from surveys, usability testing, or research easily accessible (self-written or auto-generated).
    *   **User Story**: A defined story for estimation and development efforts, including task description, expected outcomes, acceptance criteria, and visual images. It's a work item for a Scrum sprint.

**Measuring UX**:
*   Measuring helps understand if a project, product, or feature is successful.
*   This is done by defining **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**, which are measurable criteria delivering numerical value for understanding and comparison.
*   KPIs vary as every project is unique, so **knowing what success means** for a project is crucial.
*   Ideally, a KPI can be affected over time for **long-term tracking** to understand product development and compare measurements.
*   It's important to **set a goal** for KPI movement.
*   **Example**: For new features (detailed product info, shipping calculator, real-time tracking) addressing high call volumes about unclear webshop info, valid KPIs could be **Amount of Servicetickets, Inbound Calls, or Feature Adoptions**.
*   **Other general metrics/KPIs**: Orders per Day, Logins per Day, Paid Users, New Users, Session Length, Revenue per User, Time to first purchase, Feature Adoption Rate, Churn Rate, Amount of Bugs, Downtime/Uptime, Cost per Install, Retention Rate, Daily Active User (DAU), Feature Usage.
*   KPIs can be clustered into categories like **revenue-based, engagement, or performance** for easier selection.
*   **Product Analytics** is used to follow up on metrics, providing valuable real-time insights and easy access to understand user interaction with the product.
*   KPI and Product Analytics insights help **focus and steer efforts**, understand success, identify areas for focus, and track product evolution.
*   **Frameworks for aligning metrics and communication**:
    *   **North Star Metric**: A single metric indicating success or created value over a period, representing a **core value to the product and success, related to the vision**. It can be influenced by smaller-scale metrics, helping steer effort in iterative cycles and achieve value. Finding the right North Star and supporting KPIs is an iterative exercise, often requiring planning tools and regular meetings to review progress. A task is given to define a North Star and supporting indicators for the Discover Europe project.
    *   **Objectives and Key Results (OKR)**: Objectives are goals to reach over time, while Key Results are measurable values or results that fulfill the objectives when reached. OKRs create a structured framework for **setting, tracking, and evaluating goals**. They help companies gain **Focus, Accountability, Alignment, Transparency, and Engagement**, pushing teams towards shared goals. Objectives should be inspiring, memorable, and challenging, while Key Results must be quantifiable and can represent KPIs. The OKR formula is: **"We will [Objective] as measured by [these Key Results]"**. Example: "We will launch our new app as measured by 3 active app store listings". OKRs can be created in fixed periods (e.g., quarterly, semi-annually). A task is given to write an OKR for the Discover Europe project.
*   **KPI Tree**: A layered representation of single metrics that influence each other and build up, similar to the North Star, where detailed metrics influence higher-level ones.

**Measuring User Experience in a quantitative way**:
*   General KPIs may not tell enough about actual users.
*   UX-specific metrics help gather more relevant insights and are backed by scoring systems, evaluating user interaction with the product.
*   These metrics provide opportunities to measure UX efforts and gain valuable long-term insights, complementing common product metrics to understand user behavior changes.
*   **Examples of quantitative UX metrics**: System Usability Scale (SUS), After Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), Net Promoter Score (NPS), Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX), User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ).

**Cost Justification**:
*   Metrics and KPIs can help **justify project costs**.
*   With the right metrics, spending for development can be argued.
*   **Example**: Justifying 3 months of research, design, and development for a new app feature by arguing benefits like user growth by 10%, subscription base growth by 2.5%, and Daily Active Users raising by 5%. These values directly influence company performance (e.g., more subscriptions mean more money), allowing for calculation of direct financial impact and possible additional income.
*   Time saved on a task through product enhancements can also save the company money.
*   Besides KPIs and direct financial impact, other considerations for justifying costs include: **Team budget, Hardware and Equipment, Licenses, Office Rent, Server costs, Travel budget, Time constraints, Research and Studies, Salaries, Revenue, and Advertising, Trainings**.

**Collaboration with Event Storming**:
*   **Event Storming** is a brainstorming technique for **managing knowledge about the current state and future opportunities of a business domain**.
*   It brings together multiple experts from various backgrounds to create **shared knowledge and ubiquitous language**.
*   **Ubiquitous language** is a unified common language within a domain, where everyone uses the same words for the same thing, built through creating a glossary.
*   The process involves understanding the domain by mapping events, actions, and users on a timeline, adding policies and details, and discussing.
*   As understanding grows, processes are mapped out, and opportunities for improvement can be spotted. This format engages tech, product, and other stakeholders.

The summary for this chapter covers Deliverables and Examples, KPIs, Frameworks to track Success (North Star, OKR), Cost Justification, and Collaboration with Event Storming.
